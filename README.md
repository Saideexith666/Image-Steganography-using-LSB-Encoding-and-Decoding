# Image-Steganography-using-LSB-Encoding-and-Decoding
The art and science of hiding information by embedding messages within other,
seemingly harmless messages. Bits of unused data are replaced by bits of valuable
information using LSB mechanism. Sender and receiver will have individual key/secret
based on which they will be able to extract the actual data from the image. This project
also gives basic level understanding of image processing methodologies.
Real Time Applications :
1.Secure Communication – Used to transmit confidential messages or data secretly over public networks.
2.Defense and Intelligence Communication – Enables secret exchange of sensitive information in military or intelligence operations.
